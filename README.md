# Cave collec extension
Chrome extension that allows the user to add a read/not-read tag on mangacollec.
A button appears on every page of a volume to define if you read it or not.

On the edition page, all read volumes have a yellow checkmark, nothing for the not read ones. (See screenshots on the chrome websore)
